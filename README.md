## Structure

This additional material is split into three parts:

* *NoisyNER*: You can find our newly proposed dataset for evaluating noisy-label settings in this separate repository https://github.com/uds-lsv/NoisyNER
* *Noise Estimation Experiments*: The code for the experiments comparing the theoretical, expected noise model error to the empirical measurements can be found in the subdirectory *exp_noise_model_error*.
* *Base Model Performance*: The code for the experiments showing the relationship between noise estimation and base model performance can be found in the subdirectory *exp_base_model_performance*.

Please refer to the README files in each directory for additional information on installation, reproduction, etc.
